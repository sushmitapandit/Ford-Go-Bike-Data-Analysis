# Analysis by Sushmita Pandit
FordGoBike Project Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system. Bay Area Bike Share was introduced in 2013 as a pilot program for the region, with 700 bikes and 70 stations across San Francisco and San Jose. By the end of 2018, Ford GoBike will grow to 7,000 bikes across San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose.is the Bay Area's new bike share system, with thousands of public bikes for use across the greater San Francisco Bay area. An app was also created to co-piloting for getting around town. Ford has also introduced an ebike called Ford GoBike Plus on April 24th 2018 which is a motorized bike rides. We assume that this would attract more people to ride the bikes without breaking a sweat. For more information on this program, please go to https://www.fordgobike.com
